            <p>Churros are traditional Spanish desserts. They are made from dough pastry-predominantly choux- which is fried and dusted in cinnamon sugar. They are popular in Spain, France, the Philippines, Portugal, South America and Southwestern United States. They can be long and thin or thick, straight or twisted and knotted.</p>

            <p>Churros taste like cinnamon doughnuts  but BETTER because you've got crispy ridges. The inside is fluffy like a doughnut and they are at their prime freshly made, but they reheat exceptionally well too making them a great make ahead for parties!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
                <li>1 cup water</li>
                <li>1/2 cup margarine</li>
                <li>1 cup all=purpose flour</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinammon</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.</li>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil. Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip.</li>
                <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; roll churros in the mixture while still hot.</li>
